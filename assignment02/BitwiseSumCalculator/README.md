## Problem: BitwiseSumCalculator

# Description

Develop a method to compute the sum of two integers a and b using bitwise operations only, without utilizing the traditional addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators.

Inputs:

**a (int): An integer representing the first operand.

**b (int): An integer representing the second operand.


Output:

**int: The result of adding a and b using bitwise operations.



Constraints:

**Both a and b are within the 32-bit signed integer range.

**The solution should handle both positive and negative integers effectively.



#Example

**Input: a = 4, b = 5 

**Output:  9
