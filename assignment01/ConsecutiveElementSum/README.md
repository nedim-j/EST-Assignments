## Problem: Consecutive Elements Sum

# Description
The goal of the Consecutive Elements Sum is to find the largest sum of consecutive elements in a given array of integers.  "consecutive" in this context refers to elements that are next to each other in a sequence or array, without any gaps between them. 


Inputs:

**An integer array numbers which can contain both positive and negative integers.

Output:

**An integer representing the maximum sum of any consecutive elements within the array.

Behavior:

**The method should efficiently find the maximum sum possible from any consecutive subarray within the given array.

**Consider the case where the array might be empty, which should return a sum of 0.

**If all numbers are negative, the method should return the highest single element. 


#Example

**Input: numbers = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

**Output: 6 (from the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1])
