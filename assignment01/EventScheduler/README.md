## Problem: EventScheduler

# Description

This problem requires implementing a method to detect any scheduling conflicts among a set of events. Each event is represented by a pair of integers indicating the start time and end time (inclusive). The method must check if any two events overlap. The challenge is to determine the most efficient way to find conflicts without checking every pair of events naively.

Inputs:

**int[][] events, where each sub-array contains two integers [startTime, endTime]


Output:

**boolean indicating whether there is at least one conflict

Behavior:

**The method should handle an empty array of events and arrays with only one pair without returning a conflict.

**The method should return true as soon as a conflict is found without further checks.


#Example

**Input: events = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7]]

**Output: True
