Feel free to edit any other cell, file, or even install new packages (in which case you must submit them in a comment at the beginning).

    "# Task 01 - Investigating the Effect of Starting Seeds\n",
    "In the above run, our fuzzer covers 40 lines using only one starting seed (\"https://uzh.ch\"). Your first task is to investigate the effect of the starting seed in fuzzer performance. We remind that fuzzer performance is usually measure by the achieved coverage of the fuzzer (higher coverage => higher probability of exposing bugs => better performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the coverage of the `MutationBlackboxFuzzer` with one seed vs ten seeds. The choice of the ten seeds is up to you, you can either handpick ten random urls, or write a small script that randomly navigates the web and returns ten urls for more diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the performance of two fuzzers (or the same fuzzer with different configurations in our case) is a nuanced topic due to the inherent randomness of fuzzing. For example, if we run the `MutationBlackboxFuzzer` with one seed and cover 40 lines, and then run it with ten seeds and cover 42 lines, can we claim that the more starting seeds the better? Probably not.\n",
    "To make claims based on empirical data, we have to run statistical tests. In fuzzing, typically each fuzzer configuration is ran for 30 runs of 10,000 trials (i.e., you run the above cell 30 times), yielding an array of 30 coverage values for each fuzzer. The two arrays are then compared using the Mann-Whitney U Test with the null hypothesis that the values of the first array (i.e., coverage of the first fuzzer) are greater than those of the second array. If the p-value of the test is <0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, claiming that the first fuzzer achieves less coverage than the second one (with confidence level 1-0.05 = 95%).\n",
    "You can run the Mann-Whitney U Test in python with the following code:\n",

    "# Task 02: Investigating the Effect of More Sophisticated Mutations\n",
    "The mutation function we implemented above (and in the lecture) is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def mutate(s, num_of_mutations = 1):\n",
    "    mutators = [delete_random, insert_random, flip_random]\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(num_of_mutations):\n",
    "        mutator_ind = random.randint(0, 2)\n",
    "        selected_mutator = mutators[mutator_ind]\n",
    "        s = selected_mutator(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement a more sophisticated mutation strategy by:\n",
    "1. Extending the `mutate(s, num_of_mutations = 1)` function above to support three more mutators\n",
    "    - Addition of small integers to a random byte\n",
    "    - Replacing a random byte with a completely random byte value\n",
    "    - Block duplucation (insert a random block of characters of `s` in a random position of `s`)\n",
    "2. Extending the `mutate(self, s)` method of `MutationBlackboxFuzzer` so that with probability `p` it calls the `mutate(s, num_of_mutations = 1)` function above and with probability `1-p` mutates the input using **splicing**; Splicing (a.k.a, crossover) refers to selecting another seed from the existing population, and merging a random block of the new seed with the current seed at a random position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the performance of your new fuzzer with the previous fuzzer over 30 runs of 5000 trials each. Use a single starting seed `s=[\"https://www.swissinfo.ch\"]`. What can you claim about the effect of more complex mutations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For more information about the exact mutations used in the most popular fuzzer, AFL, you can have a look at this blog by the AFL creator: https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/08/binary-fuzzing-strategies-what-works.html"
