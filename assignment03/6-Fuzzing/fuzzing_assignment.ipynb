    "In the above run, our fuzzer covers 40 lines using only one starting seed (\"https://uzh.ch\"). Your first task is to investigate the effect of the starting seed in fuzzer performance. We remind that fuzzer performance is usually measure by the achieved coverage of the fuzzer (higher coverage => higher probability of exposing bugs => better performance).\n",

    "Comparing the performance of two fuzzers (or the same fuzzer with different configurations in our case) is a nuanced topic due to the inherent randomness of fuzzing. For example, if we run the `MutationBlackboxFuzzer` with one seed and cover 40 lines, and then run it with ten seeds and cover 42 lines, can we claim that the more starting seeds the better? Probably not.\n",
    "To make claims based on empirical data, we have to run statistical tests. In fuzzing, typically each fuzzer configuration is ran for 30 runs of 10,000 trials (i.e., you run the above cell 30 times), yielding an array of 30 coverage values for each fuzzer. The two arrays are then compared using the Mann-Whitney U Test with the null hypothesis that the values of the first array (i.e., coverage of the first fuzzer) are greater than those of the second array. If the p-value of the test is <0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, claiming that the first fuzzer achieves less coverage than the second one (with confidence level 1-0.05 = 95%).\n",
